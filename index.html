            I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
            There is just one thing I need<br>
            I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree<br>
            I just want you for my own<br>
            More than you could ever know<br>
            Make my wish come true<br>
            All I want for Christmas is you<br>
            Yeah<br>
            I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
            There is just one thing I need (and I)<br>
            Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree<br>
            I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace<br>
            Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day<br>
            I just want you for my own<br>
            More than you could ever know<br>
            Make my wish come true<br>
            All I want for Christmas is you<br>
            You, baby<br>
            Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas<br>
            I won't even wish for snow (and I)<br>
            I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe<br>
            I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick<br>
            I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click<br>
            'Cause I just want you here tonight<br>
            Holding on to me so tight<br>
            What more can I do?<br>
            Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you<br>
            You, baby<br>
            Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)<br>
            And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)<br>
            And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)<br>
            I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br>
            Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)<br>
            Won't you please bring my baby to me?<br>
            Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
            This is all I'm asking for<br>
            I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door<br>
            Oh, I just want you for my own<br>
            More than you could ever know<br>
            Make my wish come true<br>
            Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you<br>
            You, baby<br>
            All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
            All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
            All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
            All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby<br>
            All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
